From 17<sup>th<\/sup> century ear trumpets to bone anchored hearing implantable devices, technology has been an inseparable component of hearing care. The two are so entwined that it\u2019s hard to discuss hearing care of any kind without also discussing the technologies that are key enablers of that care.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Through innovative technologies, new avenues for hearing care have been created that will improve the patient experience. Key among these is <strong>telehealth<\/strong>. Telehealth can be described as any remote technology that assists patients in communicating with their healthcare providers. It could take the form of video conferencing, a messaging app, or even a simple phone call.<\/p>\n<p>The Ida Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Denmark working to advance a person-centered approach to hearing care, has developed a set of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.idainstitute.com\/telecare\">Telecare Tools<\/a> aimed at helping people with hearing loss. The online Telecare Tools help people with hearing loss to articulate their unique needs and circumstances to their hearing care professional. The tools are designed to involve people with hearing loss in their own care, making them partners with their hearing care professional.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The Telecare Tools help people with hearing loss prepare for their first and follow-up appointments and list strategies to manage daily life more easily. The tools assist people with hearing loss in voicing challenges and priorities more clearly and upfront in the appointment with their hearing care professional. The appointment can then more immediately focus on what is most important to the people with hearing loss. By being prompted to think about and articulate their individual needs, the people with hearing loss become more aware of difficult environments, coping needs, and the effect of their hearing loss on loved ones.<\/p>\n<p>All the tools can be accessed for free below\u00a0or at the Ida Institute\u2019s website at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.idainstitute.com\/telecare\">idainstitute.com\/telecare<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Telecare Tools to Supplement Your Hearing Care Technology affects every facet of our lives and of course hearing care is no exception.
