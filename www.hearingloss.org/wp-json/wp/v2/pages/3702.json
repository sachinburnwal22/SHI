Our advocacy efforts range from the grassroots, local level all the way up to Capitol Hill. In fact, some of the most powerful and effective advocacy efforts begin with you &#8211; the person with hearing loss.<\/p>\n<p>We advocate for communication access in the workplace, hotels, schools, court systems, medical, and entertainment facilities. HLAA promotes new technology, medical research, and legislation that will alleviate the effects of hearing loss, and we encourage and participate in research to improve hearing aids, assistive listening devices, and other technology needs of consumers with hearing loss.<\/p>\n<p>HLAA also promotes and encourages self-advocacy. Speak up, whether it&#8217;s at school, work, social activities or even at home. Let people know you have a hearing loss and tell them what you need to best communicate.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Statement of Strategic Intent<\/h2>\n<p>The HLAA Board of Directors adopted a Statement of Strategic Intent in June 2012. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hearingloss.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Statement-of-Strategic-Intent-HLAA-June-2012-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full statement<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>HLAA seeks to enable people with hearing loss to live life fully and without compromise.\u00a0Success will be achieved when:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stigma withers away. Hearing loss is no longer considered shameful.<\/li>\n<li>People take action. Effective, affordable, and easy-to-use hearing devices are routinely<br \/>\nworn by people with hearing loss.<\/li>\n<li>Costs come down. Medicare and all other insurance plans cover a full range of hearing<br \/>\ntechnology and aural rehabilitation programs.<\/li>\n<li>More public spaces are communication accessible. High-quality assistive listening devices<br \/>\nand captions are available in theaters, transportation, government buildings, and houses of<br \/>\nworship.<\/li>\n<li>Consumers have know-how. People understand how to successfully cope with their hearing<br \/>\nloss, and how to obtain and use the technology and therapies they require.<\/li>\n<li>Providers follow best practices. Clinicians offer a wide spectrum of devices and treatments,<br \/>\nknow how they work, and base care on an assessment of each person\u2019s hearing and lifestyle<br \/>\nneeds.<\/li>\n<li>Technology works seamlessly. Audio devices, including mobile phones, easily connect to<br \/>\none another without glitches, incompatibilities, or additional devices like streamers.<\/li>\n<li>Hearing loss is recognized as a key public health issue. Healthy hearing is deemed essential<br \/>\nto human physical and psychosocial health so that screening for hearing loss occurs<br \/>\nroutinely in primary care.<\/li>\n<li>Hearing loss prevention is routine.
