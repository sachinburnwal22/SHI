I have a hearing loss and know first-hand the daily struggles people with hearing loss encounter. HLAA has been a life-saver for me and thousands of people, over the last 30+ years, providing support and information through local HLAA Chapters, <em>Hearing Life<\/em> (formerly<em>\u00a0Hearing Loss Magazine<\/em>), and the annual\u00a0 HLAA Convention.\u00a0I have made a planned gift to ensure that HLAA will have the financial resources to continue their work, and as an expression of my personal appreciation and support for a dynamic and caring organization. I hope that others will make the same commitment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Peter C. Fackler, HLAA board member and former board president, said, \u201cHLAA is a lifesaver for people with hearing loss \u2013 I know because I have a hearing loss. HLAA\u2019s Walk4Hearing has helped raise awareness and reduce the stigma. HLAA is widely respected as the leading consumer advocacy organization for people with hearing loss and works ensure communication accessibility and compliance with laws and regulations before federal agencies, departments, and Congress. Making a planned gift is a difficult decision \u2013 but I know that my gift will ensure that future generations will benefit from the great work of this organization.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leave a Legacy of Helping the Hearing Loss Association of America Planned Giving is For Everyone Many HLAA supporters choose to leave a planned gift in their estate plan.
