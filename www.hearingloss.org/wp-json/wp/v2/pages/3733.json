Hearing screening is easy and is not painful. In fact, babies are often asleep while being screened. It usually only a few minutes.<\/li>\n<li>The earlier a hearing loss is detected and treated in infants the better the outcome for language and speech development. Find an audiologist who specializes in pediatrics and find out all you can about hearing aids and\/or cochlear implants.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>In children, hearing loss can be confused with a learning disability when, in fact, the child might not be hearing clearly what the teacher is saying.<\/li>\n<li>Even a mild hearing loss or a one-sided hearing loss can affect school work. Research has shown that on average, children with mild hearing loss perform poorer than their normally-hearing peers and may need to repeat a grade.<\/li>\n<li>More than ever, young people are at risk for hearing loss because of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hearingloss.org\/hearing-help\/hearing-loss-basics\/prevention\/\">repeated exposure to loud sounds<\/a>\u00a0from musical instruments, ear buds, and any personal listening device inserted in the ear. Any sort of sound can cause a permanent hearing loss if it is loud enough and lasts long enough.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Teaching Mainstreamed Students with Hearing Loss<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Video for Parents, Teachers and Students<\/strong><br \/>\nHLAA Member Zina Jawadi, produced a video for teachers and school staff who have students with hearing loss.
