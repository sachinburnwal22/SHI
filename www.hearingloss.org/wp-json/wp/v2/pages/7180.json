They are hand-held amplifiers with microphones that bring the sound you wish to hear closer to your ears. These small devices capture the sound you want to hear and may filter some background noise. A Pocketalker is an inexpensive, wired, example of this type of device. There are other personal devices, such as wireless FM devices and propriety devices that are sold by audiologists as ancillary equipment to various brands of hearing aids and cochlear implants.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>An example of how you might use this type of device is communicating with a family member at a large family gathering. Your family members speak (one at a time) into the microphone, and the sound is transmitted to your hearing device reducing competing noise, so you can understand them more clearly.<\/p>\n<h2>Hear Better in Public Places<\/h2>\n<p>Several types of Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) are available to improve sound transmission for people with hearing loss. Some are designed for large facilities such as classrooms, theaters, places of worship, and airports. Other types are intended for personal use in small settings and for one-on-one conversations. All can be used with or without hearing aids or a cochlear implant.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Assistive Listening Systems (ALSs) are the gateway through which people with hearing loss access the sound being transmitted through a public address system or sound system. If a person wants to conveniently connect to one of these systems, it is useful for their hearing device have a telecoil.\u00a0ALS for large facilities include <strong>hearing loop systems<\/strong>,<strong> frequency-modulated (FM) systems<\/strong>, and <strong>infrared systems<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>All assistive listening systems should be usable by people with hearing aids, with hearing aids but no telecoil, and without hearing aids.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>What if I don&#8217;t have a hearing aid or cochlear implant?<\/strong> If you struggle to hear but don&#8217;t yet have a hearing aid or cochlear implant, an ALS can still help. People who do not have hearing-aids and people do not have telecoils in their\u00a0hearing aids can use a hearing loop, FM or IR system if they have a receiver that is connected to headphones.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hear Better in Conversations Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) are personal technologies that can help you communicate in one-to-one conversations.
