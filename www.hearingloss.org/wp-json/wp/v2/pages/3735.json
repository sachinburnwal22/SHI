A report from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs estimated that more than 60,000 military members are on disability for hearing loss from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.<\/p>\n<p>HLAA was founded in 1979 by Howard \u201cRocky\u201d Stone, a retired CIA agent, who endured hearing loss from his service in the United States Army. Rocky was well-known in the agency for both his skill and his hearing loss. On one occasion he was having a hard time \u201chearing\u201d when talking with then-Director Richard Helms, so Rocky plopped himself on Helms\u2019 desk and asked him to face him directly so he could read his lips! Another time, his old-fashioned body hearing aid was mistaken for a recording spy device and was confiscated. Rocky earned the Agency\u2019s highest honor and went onto establish an organization for people who have hearing loss and want to stay in the hearing world with technology and strategies.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-10199 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hearingloss.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Veteransvirtualchapter_purple-450x220.jpg\" alt=\"Veterans Across America Logo\" width=\"258\" height=\"126\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hearingloss.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Veteransvirtualchapter_purple-450x220.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.hearingloss.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Veteransvirtualchapter_purple-768x375.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.hearingloss.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Veteransvirtualchapter_purple.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px\" \/><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.2px;\">HLAA Veterans Across America Virtual Chapter (VAAVC)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>HLAA is excited to announce the formation of our very first virtual chapter for veterans with hearing loss.

Recently retired after 20 years of service in the U.S. Army, David Schible continues to fight the war on hearing loss, speaking to every arriving soldier at Fort Stewart to educate them about noise and hearing loss. David doesn&#8217;t consider himself a hero after deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq and Kuwait. But he is to us &#8211; in addition to serving this great country, David spends much of his personal time giving back to the community, often with the Sergeant Audie Murphy Club which does charity work for the homeless and helps the elderly. He also volunteers at the Fort Steward Child Development Center, assisting the games and fun activities for the children. The list of his involvement in his community goes on.
