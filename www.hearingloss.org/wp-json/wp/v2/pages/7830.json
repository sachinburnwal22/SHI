Congress requires video programming distributors &#8212; \u00a0cable operators, broadcasters, satellite distributors and other multi-channel video programming distributors &#8212; to close caption their TV programs.<\/p>\n<p>The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) considers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/consumers\/guides\/closed-captioning-television\">closed captioning for TV<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/general\/closed-captioning-video-programming-delivered-using-internet-protocol-ip\">closed captioning delivered using the internet<\/a> an assistive technology that allows persons with hearing loss to access television programming under the Telecommunications Act.\u00a0\u00a0For a TV to display closed captions, it must have integrated decoder circuitry, which is activated either on the TV&#8217;s remote control or through the menu.<\/p>\n<p>Closed captioning is often critical to people to people with hearing loss; sometimes people can &#8220;hear&#8221; the words but can&#8217;t understand them. Television is the primary source of local information in an emergency for many. Both TV and movie captioning is clearly a source of information, education and entertainment. But, you don\u2019t have to have a hearing loss to find closed captioning useful: people for whom English is a second language use captions to get a better grasp of English, children\u2019s reading is enhanced with the use of captions, and hearing people in bars, gyms, airports, and other noisy places appreciate the value of captioning.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the FCC\u2019s requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For television captioning visit:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/cgb\/dro\/caption.html\">fcc.gov\/cgb\/dro\/caption.html<\/a><\/li>\n<li>For Internet captioning visit:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/cgb\/dro\/cvaa.html\">fcc.gov\/cgb\/dro\/cvaa.html<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Section 255 of the Communications Act, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, requires telecommunications products and services to be accessible to people with disabilities.
