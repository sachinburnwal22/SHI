Normally, these sounds are at safe levels that don\u2019t damage our hearing. But sounds can be harmful when they are too loud, even for a brief time, or when they are both loud and long-lasting. These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).<\/p>\n<p>NIHL can be immediate or it can take a long time to be noticeable. It can be temporary or permanent, and it can affect one ear or both ears. Even if you can\u2019t tell that you are damaging your hearing, you could have trouble hearing in the future, such as not being able to understand other people when they talk, especially on the phone or in a noisy room. Regardless of how it might affect you, one thing is certain: noise-induced hearing loss is something you can prevent.<\/p>\n<h1 id=\"2\">Who is affected by NIHL?<\/h1>\n<p>Exposure to harmful noise can happen at any age. People of all ages, including children, teens, young adults, and older people, can develop NIHL. Based on a 2011-2012 CDC study involving hearing tests and interviews with participants, at least 10 million\u00a0adults (6 percent) in the U.S. under age 70\u2014and perhaps as many as 40 million adults (24 percent)\u2014have features of their hearing test that suggest hearing loss in one or both ears from exposure to loud noise. Researchers have also estimated that as many as 17 percent of teens (ages 12 to 19) have features of their hearing test suggestive of NIHL in one or both ears (<a href=\"http:\/\/pediatrics.aappublications.org\/content\/127\/1\/e39.long\">Pediatrics 2011<\/a>), based on data from 2005-2006.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every day, we experience sound in our environment, such as the sounds from television and radio, household appliances, and traffic.
