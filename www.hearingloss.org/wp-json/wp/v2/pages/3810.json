If a person has direct experience with a charitable organization, GreatNonprofits makes it easier for him or her to share that knowledge so that other people can discover that group as well. GreatNonprofits does not write the reviews. Rather, like at Amazon, reviews and ratings are posted by people who have been touched by a nonprofit and want to share their story about it. Therefore, you&#8217;ll discover stories of people who have volunteered or donated to nonprofits, as well as stories of people who have benefited from their services. <a href=\"http:\/\/greatnonprofits.org\/reviews\/profile2\/hearing-loss-association-of-america-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read HLAA&#8217;s reviews<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n<h3>\n<p>Verified Compliance Shield Award<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-20882  alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hearingloss.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/compliance-shield-2022.png\" alt=\"Verified state registrations compliance shield\" width=\"194\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.hearingloss.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/compliance-shield-2022.png 350w, https:\/\/www.hearingloss.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/compliance-shield-2022-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px\" \/>State Solicitation Registration Charities of America (SSRCA) has awarded your charity its Verification Compliance Shield. SSRCA recognizes\u00a0non-profits that are compliant with state solicitation requirements including current approvals\u00a0and registrations in process. SSRCA strongly encourages\u00a0all non-profits to become educated about each state\u2019s solicitation requirements. Where applicable, non-profits must adhere to these requirements by completing each state\u2019s application process. SSCRA stands by state solicitation officials and their duty to protect the public against fraudulent charities. SSCRA\u2019s Compliance Shield of Approval is awarded to charities that are working hand-in-hand with state solicitation offices to protect the public and defend the reputation of our charitable community.<\/p>\n<p><!--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.give.org\/charity-reviews\/national\/health\/hearing-loss-association-of-america-in-bethesda-md-38598\">BBB Wise Giving Alliance (Give.org)<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-16117  alignleft\" style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.hearingloss.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/bbb-wise-giving-logo.png\" alt=\"BBB Wise Giving Logo\" width=\"221\" height=\"100\" \/>The BBB Wise Giving Alliance helps donors make informed giving decisions and promotes high standards of conduct among organizations that solicit contributions from the public.
