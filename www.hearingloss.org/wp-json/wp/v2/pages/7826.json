The standards for determining employment discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act are the same as those used in Title I of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.access-board.gov\/\">Americans with Disabilities Act<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Section 501<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Section 501 requires affirmative action and nondiscrimination in employment by federal agencies of the executive branch. To obtain more information or to file a complaint, employees should contact their agency\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eeoc.gov\/laws\/statutes\/rehab.cfm\">Equal Employment Opportunity Office<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Section 503<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>On September 24, 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs published a Final Rule in the\u00a0<em>Federal Register<\/em>\u00a0revising the regulations implementing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/ofccp\/regs\/compliance\/section503.htm\">Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act<\/a> of 1973, as amended (Section 503) at 41 CFR Part 60\u2013741. The regulations became effective on March 24, 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Section 503 prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating in employment against individuals with disabilities (IWDs), and requires these employers to take affirmative action to recruit, hire, promote, and retain these individuals. As revised, the regulations strengthen the affirmative action provisions to aid contractors in their efforts to recruit and hire IWDs, and improve job opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The regulations also include changes to the nondiscrimination provisions to bring them into compliance with the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Section 504<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Section 504 states that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability in the United States shall be excluded from, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\u201d any program or activity that either receives federal financial assistance or is conducted by any Executive agency or the United States Postal Service.<\/p>\n<p>Each federal agency has its own set of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/oasam\/regs\/statutes\/sec504.htm\">section 504 regulations<\/a> that apply to its own programs. Agencies that provide federal financial assistance also have section 504 regulations covering entities that receive federal aid. Requirements common to these regulations include reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities; program accessibility; effective communication with people who have hearing or vision disabilities; and accessible new construction and alterations. Each agency is responsible for enforcing its own regulations. Section 504 may also be enforced through private lawsuits. It is not necessary to file a complaint with a federal agency or to receive a \u201cright-to-sue\u201d letter before going to court.<\/p>\n<p>For information on how to file 504 complaints with the appropriate agency, contact:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Disability Rights Section Mailing Address<br \/>\n<\/strong>U.S. Department of Justice<br \/>\n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW<br \/>\nCivil Rights Division<br \/>\nDisability Rights Section \u2013 NYA\u00a0<br \/>\nWashington, D.C. 20530<\/p>\n<p><strong>Section Phone Number:\u00a0<\/strong>202-307-0663<br \/>\n<strong>Section Fax Number:\u00a0<\/strong>202-307-1197<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (d))<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities.

Under Section 508, agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to access available to others. The United States Access Board\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.access-board.gov\/guidelines-and-standards\/communications-and-it\/about-the-section-508-standards\/background\/section-508-the-law\">discusses the Section 508 law<\/a>\u00a0and its responsibility for developing accessibility standards for EIT to incorporate into regulations that govern federal procurement practices.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>NEW: 508 Standards Refresh<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>On January 18, 2017 the Access Board issued a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.access-board.gov\/guidelines-and-standards\/communications-and-it\/about-the-ict-refresh\/final-rule\"><strong>final rule<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0that updates accessibility requirements for information and communication technology (ICT) in the federal sector covered by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The rule also refreshes guidelines for telecommunications equipment subject to Section 255 of the Communications Act. The rule jointly updates and reorganizes the Section 508 standards and Section 255 guidelines in response to market trends and innovations, such as the convergence of technologies. The refresh also harmonizes these requirements with other guidelines and standards both in the U.S. and abroad, including standards issued by the European Commission and with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), a globally recognized voluntary consensus standard for web content and ICT. In fact, the rule references Level A and Level AA Success Criteria and Conformance Requirements in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/intro\/wcag.php\">WCAG 2.0 (link is external)<\/a>\u00a0and applies them not only to websites, but also to electronic documents and software.
