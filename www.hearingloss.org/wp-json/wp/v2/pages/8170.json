According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the law\u2019s goal is to make health insurance available and affordable to people and small groups, such as employees of small businesses and organizations, who are uninsured. While some provisions of the law have already taken effect, many more provisions will be implemented in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p>HLAA Chapters and state organizations as well as individual HLAA members working with their state offices for hard of hearing and deaf people, with state insurance commissioners, and with state legislatures, have an opportunity to advocate to add or expand coverage for hearing aids in future ACA plans. It will take forethought, good planning, and some roll-up-your-sleeves advocacy for those willing to increase hearing aid coverage under the ACA.<\/p>\n<h4>Alabama<\/h4>\n<p><em>Status of Benchmark Plan:<\/em>\u00a0 Default to Federal Exchange<\/p>\n<p><em>Benchmark Plan Name:<\/em>\u00a0 BCBS of Alabama, 320 Plan, PPO, Small Group Plan<\/p>\n<p><em>Coverage:<\/em>\u00a0 Hearing aids not covered.<\/p>\n<h4>Alaska<\/h4>\n<p><em>Status of Benchmark Plan:\u00a0 <\/em>Default to Federal Exchange<\/p>\n<p><em>Benchmark Plan Name:<\/em>\u00a0 BCBS of Alaska \u2013 Alaska Heritage Select Envoy, PPO, Small Group Plan<\/p>\n<p><em>Coverage:<\/em>\u00a0 Hearing aids not covered.<\/p>\n<h4>Arizona<\/h4>\n<p><em>Status of Benchmark Plan:<\/em>\u00a0 Default to Federal Exchange<\/p>\n<p><em>Benchmark Plan Name:<\/em>\u00a0 State Employee Benefit \u2013 United HealthCare EPO<\/p>\n<p><em>Coverage<\/em>:\u00a0 One (1) hearing aid per ear per year and hearing exam covered.<\/p>\n<h4>Arkansas<\/h4>\n<p><em>Status of Benchmark Plan:<\/em>\u00a0 HHS conditionally approved State Partnership Marketplace plan.<\/p>\n<p><em>Benchmark Plan Name:<\/em>\u00a0 Arkansas BCBS Health HMO Advantage Partnership Open Access (POS)<\/p>\n<p><em>Coverage:<\/em>\u00a0 Hearing aids not covered.<\/p>\n<h4>California<\/h4>\n<p><em>Status of Benchmark Plan:<\/em>\u00a0 HHS conditionally approved State Marketplace plan.<\/p>\n<p><em>Benchmark Plan Name:<\/em>\u00a0 Kaiser Small Group HMO<\/p>\n<p><em>Coverage:<\/em>\u00a0 Hearing aids not covered.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h4>Colorado<\/h4>\n<p><em>Status of Benchmark Plan:<\/em>\u00a0 HHS conditionally approved State Marketplace plan.<\/p>\n<p><em>Benchmark Plan Name:<\/em>\u00a0 Kaiser Ded\/CO HMO 1200D Small Group Plan<\/p>\n<p><em>Coverage:<\/em>\u00a0 Hearing aids covered for persons under the age of 18.\u00a0 (State required benefit under Colo.
