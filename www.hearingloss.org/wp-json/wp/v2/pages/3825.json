Together, the HLAA National organization, its chapters and state organizations, are all one organization working to accomplish the HLAA mission.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>HLAA Chapters<\/strong><br \/>\nChapters are local or area-wide organizations offering regularly-scheduled meetings and programs. The chapters offer emotional support, camaraderie, tips and techniques for living with hearing loss, and technical information about hearing assistance devices.<\/li>\n<li><strong>State Organizations<\/strong><br \/>\nThere are two types of HLAA statewide organizations: offices and associations. Both structures exist to work on issues that affect members in their states such as legislation, policies, programs, and communication access, to name a few.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>State Offices\u00a0<\/strong>are staffed by a single volunteer (director) appointed by the national office. State offices typically are for advocacy and represent HLAA at the state level. State offices can also provide support to the HLAA Chapters, especially if there is no state chapter coordinator.<\/li>\n<li><strong>State Associations\u00a0<\/strong>have bylaws, are incorporated in their state and operate by elected boards of directors, similar to HLAA National. Each chapter within the state has representation on the board of the state association. Every HLAA member in the state is automatically a state association member.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Structure of the Current Team HLAA Board of Directors Board members are the fiduciaries who steer the organization toward a sustainable future by adopting sound ethical and legal governance, financial management policies, as well as making sure the nonprofit has adequate resources to advance its mission.
