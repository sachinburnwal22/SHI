<h5 style="letter-spacing: 0.2px; margin-bottom: 2rem;"><strong>A new rule adopted on July 18 by the <a style="transition-property: all, all, all;" href="https://www.facebook.com/FCC?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZVmGhUpxPzRyiTqeh_y2vbG-bbIRqu-5nIw7S9HUE2UdS2WJpj_vHzbRJQmZa_8JWZgsLmmkbNRn1iZd8iuUYn6qYwnHolqs_gXGWnXYaX-rtVheWFLY0pHuhbpHSVFAA9cs7vIvPCqP0foqPHejm9xxUdhpuC-MnOQfsGmg9iioTqEI5Jj2MEzgPplbNqDOKIW-pGUKXDJWbVRXbo-4cuS&amp;__tn__=-%5dK-R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) requires television and video captioning display settings to be easier to access within two years.</strong></h5>
<p>One of the most common hot-button issues we hear within our HLAA community is frustration about how hard it is to find and adjust captioning display settings.</p>
<p>So many of us with hearing loss spend far too much time in trial-and-error mode looking for those elusive settings to help us understand speech, dialog and sound effects, and customize the text size, font, color and other features. It can seem like an endless, exasperating game of hide and seek…and seek…and seek! How often have you missed most of a TV show or news report while clicking on multiple buttons and adjustment settings without success?</p>
<p>“Thankfully, the FCC has finally taken action to ensure that captions are easier to find and program for people who benefit from this technology,” said HLAA Executive Director Barbara Kelley. “This is a huge win on behalf of those we advocate for in the hearing loss community.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft  wp-image-26882" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/caption-button-on-remote.jpg" alt="Close up of caption button on a television remote" width="304" height="255" /><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px;">On July 18, the FCC unanimously passed a rule requiring TV manufacturers and multichannel video programming distributors (e.g., cable, satellite) to make caption settings “readily accessible.” That means the Commission will look at the following factors to determine compliance: proximity, discoverability, previewability, consistency and persistence. Entities must comply within two years of publication in the Federal Register, which is expected in the coming months.</span></p>
<p>This new requirement is the result of a multi-year effort by HLAA and other groups to improve access to captions, which are essential to consumers with hearing loss and other disabilities. We collaborated with <a href="https://www.ncta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NCTA – The Internet and Television Association</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.nad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>National Association of the Deaf</strong></a> (NAD), <a href="https://tdiforaccess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TDIforAccess, Inc.</strong></a> and <a href="https://csd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Communication Services for the Deaf</strong></a> (CSD) to file a proposal and submit comments to move the issue forward.</p>
<p>Advocacy takes time and HLAA is in it for the long game. We are heartened by this FCC rule and appreciate the Commissioners’ comments acknowledging our work along with NCTA and the other consumer groups. Fortunately, we won’t be playing hide and seek with captions much longer! </p>

<h3>How to protect hearing technology during warm-weather activities</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft  wp-image-26850" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/volleyball-teens-on-beach.jpg" alt="Teenages playing beach volleyball" width="312" height="212" srcset="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/volleyball-teens-on-beach.jpg 536w , https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/volleyball-teens-on-beach-450x306.jpg 450w " sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" />We all look forward to having fun in the sun every summer. However, heat and moisture are two of the biggest enemies of hearing aids and cochlear implant processors, which makes summer activities challenging for people with hearing loss. Despite built-in protections, sweat, water and humidity can still cause problems, such as distorted or weak sound quality, reduced battery life and inconsistent functionality.</p>
<p>Better hearing is better living, and technology should keep you connected, not sidelined. The best advice is to keep up with regular hearing care visits during the summer months, so you’re prepared to fully participate in activities with family and friends.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Here are few tips to keep you hearing your best all summer long:</strong></span></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Protect hearing aids and processors from water<br />
</strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-26849 alignright" style="letter-spacing: 0.2px;" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/kayaking-young-adults.jpg" alt="Two young adults kayaking" width="234" height="272" />New waterproof devices, such as the rechargeable Genesis AI hearing aids, are made with gaskets and silicone seals, a protective nano coating inside and out and a fully enclosed battery. Although waterproof up to three feet deep, we don’t recommend swimming with them or any other hearing aids. Even waterproof hearing aids could fall out or feel uncomfortable underwater, so remove and safely store your devices before swimming. It’s also important to dry your ears and canals before reinserting them.</li>
<li><strong>Store hearing devices in a cool, dry place<br />
</strong>Whether you’re removing your devices to take a dip or to take a nap on the beach, keep them in their case in a cool, shaded place to help prevent damage. Avoid storing hearing aids and processors in a hot car, near dampness or in direct sunlight.</li>
<li><strong>Use a dry box or dehumidifier<br />
</strong>Even with today’s water-resistant technology, you may need a dehumidifier or drying kit if you live in a humid climate, are prone to sweating or do a lot of outdoor activities. Devices that take zinc-air batteries are also more prone to moisture ingress through the battery door. Consult your hearing care professional before choosing products, especially for rechargeable hearing aids which may have heat restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Keep sand, sunscreen and bug repellent away<br />
</strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-26853 alignright" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/family-on-beach.jpg" alt="Family relaxing on the beach" width="345" height="211" srcset="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/family-on-beach.jpg 471w , https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/family-on-beach-450x275.jpg 450w " sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" />Sunscreen and insect repellent can clog your microphone and/or receiver, while tiny granules of sand can cause major damage. Apply lotion or spray first, then wash your hands before inserting your hearing aids. At bedtime, wipe off devices and check for any sand before putting them back into their charger or case.</li>
<li><strong>Remove hearing devices before rides<br />
</strong>Roller coasters and spinning rides are not so amusing if your hearing aids or processors fall out during sudden movements. Be sure to remove and safely stow your hearing aids before any high-speed amusement park rides.</li>
<li><strong>Wear the right footwear<br />
</strong>What do shoes have to do with hearing? You can improve your balance and minimize the chance of tripping or stumbling when you wear well-fitting, appropriate footwear, especially during hiking and sports—which can help prevent your hearing aids from falling out.</li>
<li><strong>Get up to speed on added features<br />
</strong>Starkey hearing aids use an app that allows you to perform diagnostic tests, alerts you to needed cleaning and maintenance and sometimes even track your devices if they’re misplaced. Whatever brand you use, learn what added features and support are available, so you can stay active and involved.</li>

<p>In this blog series, we’re spotlighting three heroic teams whose long-time participation have helped HLAA bring hope to millions. Here is the third and final; read the first two blogs about <a href="https://www.hearingloss.org/walk4hearing-heroes-help-hlaa-bring-hope-team-adeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Team Adeline</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.hearingloss.org/walk4hearing-heroes-help-hlaa-bring-hope-brodys-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Brody&#8217;s Monsters</strong></a>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>$9K in Nine Years: Courtney’s Crew</strong></span></h3>
<p>Courtney’s Crew has participated in the New York City (NYC) Walk4Hearing for more than nine years, raising more than $9,000. Courtney was born with atresia and microtia, two malformations of the ear that can cause hearing loss. </p>

<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A Step in the Right Direction</strong></span></h5>
<p>Courtney has faced many challenges academically and socially, but she has never let her differences define her or hold her back. Courtney and her parents encountered numerous roadblocks getting accommodations, including institutional support for her FM system. The system, which is a hearing assistive technology that pairs a microphone with a receiver, was necessary to help Courtney process sound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000; text-align: center;">I was finally at peace when I participated in my first Walk4Hearing. So many others shared the same disability, and for once, I felt accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">– Courtney Muchow</p>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-25453 alignright" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/courtney.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="217" />While in middle school, Courtney decided to abandon her FM device altogether and learn to navigate the challenges of hearing loss on her own. She was determined to surpass her school administrators’ expectations, despite the roadblocks she experienced. She also became interested in finding ways to help others with hearing loss and stumbled across the NYC Walk4Hearing. She’s never looked back, citing the new sense of community it gave her as a comfort and inspiration.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Marching to the Beat of Her Own Drum</strong></span></h5>
<p>Courtney’s classmates often didn’t understand how exhausting a unilateral hearing loss can be, and they were sometimes confused by her quiet demeanor. Bolstered by a newfound sense of confidence that began with her participation in Walk4Hearing, she decided to shake off any sense of stigma and talk openly about her hearing loss with her classmates. She made a commitment to being her authentic self, even going so far as to pull her hair back, rather than using it to hide her ears. Courtney not only acknowledged her hearing loss but also became comfortable enough to joke about it with friends. Her courage, authenticity and unwavering focus on academic achievement were richly rewarded when she was named class valedictorian at her eighth grade awards ceremony!</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Forging Her Own Path</strong></span></h5>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft  wp-image-25455" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/courtneys-crew.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="265" />After graduating from high school third in her class of more than 600 students, Courtney received several academic scholarships and was accepted by the University of San Francisco, where she studies psychology, neuroscience and gerontology. She also serves as the Director of Operations of the Future Clinicians Association, works in the Aging and Diversity Research Lab and is launching an intergenerational knitting club.</p>
<p>Although miles from where she started, Courtney plans to continue participating in Walk4Hearing events to give back to the organization that helped her on her path of personal growth. Her friends and family members pledge to be with her every step of the way. Courtney promises, “I will continue to be the Fruit Loop in a world of Cheerios. I will be a leader, an educator and always advocate for people in need.” </p>
<p>The next<a href="https://www.walk4hearing.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&amp;eventID=513" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> NYC Walk4Hearing</strong></a> will take place on Sunday, September 15, 2024.</p>

<figure id="attachment_26744" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26744" style="width: 341px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-26744" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/eddie-and-qais.jpg" alt="Eddie Mukaaya from Uganda and Qais Khan from the U.K." width="341" height="347" srcset="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/eddie-and-qais.jpg 500w , https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/eddie-and-qais-442x450.jpg 442w " sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26744" class="wp-caption-text">Eddie Mukaaya from Uganda and Qais Khan from the United Kingdom.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Eddie Mukaaya from Uganda told the story of his daughter. “Even as our first-born child, she had two things that already left her behind: First, she was born deaf and second, she’s a female in my country.” After the Mukaaya family traveled to the United States so their daughter could get a cochlear implant (CI), Eddie went on to establish <a href="https://hhvuganda.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Hear His Voice Uganda</strong></a> for other parents needing support and information.</p>
<p>Ordinary people are doing extraordinary things to advocate for themselves and others to get CIs, often not paid for by insurance or government programs. A pervasive lack of information and follow-up care makes their situations even more challenging.</p>
<p>CIICA’s <a href="https://ciicanet.org/2024/05/16/insights-from-delegates-ci-advocacy-in-action-in-brussels-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>first global conference</strong></a> gave people a voice who normally wouldn’t have one on the world stage. For instance, a young working mother from Slovenia sold her car to come to Brussels just to meet others with implants.</p>
<figure id="attachment_26746" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26746" style="width: 375px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-26746" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/cicca-board-iciica.jpg" alt="Picture of the CIICA board" width="375" height="360" srcset="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/cicca-board-iciica.jpg 500w , https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/cicca-board-iciica-450x432.jpg 450w " sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26746" class="wp-caption-text">The CIICA board travels from across the globe.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://ciicanet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CIICA</strong></a> is not a typical organization; it’s more like an international network of people with a common interest sharing their experiences and learning from one another. Their virtual network and popular “CIICA Conversations” draw participants from around the world, while the <a href="https://ciicanet.org/resources/ciicas-summary-of-the-living-guidelines-for-adult-ci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Living Guidelines for Adult CI</strong></a> and <a href="https://ciicanet.org/resources/a-practical-guide-for-ci-advocacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Advocacy Guide</strong></a> resources provide solid information.</p>
<p>Here in the U.S., we have laws to identify children with hearing loss at birth so they can quickly be fitted with hearing aids or receive cochlear implants. We’re fortunate that Medicare and some Medicaid plans cover CIs, as do some private health insurers. Of course, there’s always room for more advocacy, particularly in regard to hearing aid coverage and communication access—yet meeting people with varied experiences and backgrounds made it clear to me why the CIICA network is so important in countries with far fewer advantages.</p>
<figure id="attachment_26745" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26745" style="width: 301px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-26745" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/barbara-sue-archbold.jpg" alt="Barbara Kelley with Dr. Sue Archbold, coordinator of CIICA." width="301" height="269" srcset="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/barbara-sue-archbold.jpg 500w , https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/barbara-sue-archbold-450x403.jpg 450w " sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26745" class="wp-caption-text">HLAA Executive Director Barbara Kelley with Sue Archbold, Ph.D., coordinator of CIICA.</figcaption></figure>
<p>My experience also made it clear that, although HLAA is a national organization, it has a place in this world beyond our 50 states. We are a member not only of CIICA, but also of the <a href="https://www.who.int/activities/promoting-world-hearing-forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>World Health Organization’s World Hearing Forum</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Each of us in HLAA is part of this global community of people with hearing loss, doing the best we can every day to use the latest technology so we can live our best lives. Our priceless community of support provides valuable knowledge, resources, education and connection with peers.

<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>An Early Start with Walk4Hearing</strong></span></h5>
<p>Brody Fromholt was born in 2012 with a profound hearing loss caused by Usher syndrome, a rare genetic condition that affects both hearing and vision. It was identified during his newborn hearing screening and confirmed during an auditory brainstem response (ABR) test. Brody received his first pair of hearing aids at just three weeks old.</p>
<div style="margin: 10px auto 30px; padding: 10px 20px; background: #dcebeb; border: 1px solid #cccccc; width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
<blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000; text-align: center;">  Walk4Hearing has played many roles in Brody’s life, but most importantly, it has taught him the importance of being an advocate.  </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft  wp-image-25450" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/brody-at-a-walk4hearing-323x450.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="407" srcset="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/brody-at-a-walk4hearing-323x450.jpg 323w , https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/brody-at-a-walk4hearing.jpg 400w " sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" />By a quirk of fate, both Brody&#8217;s mother, Katie, and grandmother had been longtime teachers of children with hearing loss. His grandmother retired to care for Brody as a baby and Katie eventually changed jobs to work at the Kentucky School for the Deaf, which he attended.</p>
<p>Thus, upon his diagnosis, Brody’s parents were already aware of various options. They immediately went into research mode and decided upon cochlear implants (CIs). Their search for the best surgeon to perform the procedure led them to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCH). CCH sent information and resources, including an introduction to the local Walk4Hearing the following spring.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>A Family Affair from the Get-Go</strong></span></h5>
<p>In May 2013, Brody’s family participated in the Dayton Walk4Hearing, where extended family members joined the newly organized Brody’s Monsters team. Together, they proudly raised a few hundred dollars that first year and were delighted to connect with other Walk4Hearing participants in that area. Being at the Walk gave Brody’s family the opportunity to be around other people with hearing loss. Since 2013, the Brody’s Monsters team has raised more than $10,000.</p>
<h5 style="letter-spacing: 0.2px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-25452" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/brody-andm0m.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="313" /></strong></span></h5>
<p>Through Walk4Hearing, Brody’s family has networked and shared helpful resources with other nearby hearing professionals. Just 10 years after its first walk, the family now hosts its own Walk4Hearing event closer to home in Kentucky, where Katie served for two years as the Walk Chair.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Stopping Hearing Loss in Its Tracks</strong></span></h5>
<p>Brody has never let hearing loss slow him down and excels in his middle school gifted and talented program. He also plays trombone in the school band, manages the football team and produces his own videos.</p>
<p>Advocacy is especially important to Brody. He corresponded with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear regarding Usher syndrome, which led to an appearance with the governor as he signed the Usher Syndrome Awareness Day Proclamation in 2021. Brody is always happy to talk about his hearing loss and share the strategies that work best for him.</p>

<h4><em>New Air Travel Bill Includes Key Accessibility Improvements</em></h4>
<p>It’s one of the most common complaints we get at the <strong><a href="https://hearingloss.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA)</a></strong>—trouble hearing and understanding announcements in airports and airplanes—but changes are coming. A new bill mandates wide-ranging improvements to aviation safety and passenger protections, including significant benefits for travelers with <strong><a href="https://www.ndrn.org/resource/faa-reauth-thanks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing loss and other disabilities</a></strong>.</p>
<p>On May 16, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2024 was <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/16/statement-from-president-joe-biden-after-signing-faa-reauthorization-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>signed into law</strong></a> by President Biden with bipartisan support. This vital bill extends the FAA’s activities related to airport planning and development, facilities, equipment and operations through September 30, 2028.</p>
<p>HLAA has worked for years with other <a href="https://www.ndrn.org/resource/faa-reauth-thanks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>consumer disability organizations</strong></a>, including the National Disability Rights Network (NDRN), National Association of the Deaf (NAD) and Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), to get important accessibility provisions included in the bill.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Here are some of the improvements to come:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessible announcements<br />
</strong>Those muffled, hard-to-understand gate and safety announcements could get more accessible. Under the new law, all airport gates, counters, ticketing areas and customer service desks must be disability accessible, including captions for people with hearing loss.</li>
<li><strong>New</strong><strong> wheelchair safety standards  <br />
</strong>Harrowing scenarios of wheelchair damage and injuries to passengers who are taken in and out of them could diminish as the bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to improve standards for wheelchair transport and stowage.</li>
<li><strong>In-flight entertainment captioning<br />
</strong>DOT is required to issue new regulations requiring in-flight entertainment accessibility, including closed captioning and video descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Digital a</strong><strong>ccessibility<br />
</strong>Minimum standards to ensure that individuals with disabilities can access websites, software applications and kiosks are also included.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the FAA Reauthorization Act addresses a variety of general transportation issues, such as the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), aviation workforce development and air traffic controller recruitment, aircraft and pilot certifications, guaranteed family seating policies, the elimination of hidden airline fees and hassle-free refunds to passengers for delayed or canceled flights.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="alt-button" href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/BC96EBA2-77A1-401C-96A0-E9B990F4D3E4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>READ FULL TEXT OF BILL</strong></a></p>
<p>Changes could still be some way off, but this is certainly a big step in the right direction. We know this is a critical safety issue for millions with hearing loss, and ultimately will benefit all travelers in noisy airports and airplanes. A 2023 blog post about <a href="https://www.hearingloss.org/flying-with-hearing-loss-can-be-challenging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>protecting yourself while traveling with hearing loss</strong></a> remains one of our top performers, and according to HLAA Executive Director Barbara Kelley, the topic is second only to concerns about the costs of hearing aids and lack of insurance coverage.</p>
<p>If you have hearing loss and are flying, preparation can be key to your safety and success. <a href="https://www.hearingloss.org/programs-events/advocacy/know-your-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Know Your Rights</strong></a> before you go and see other important initiatives that HLAA is working on.</p>

<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Positive Steps with Friends and Family</strong></span></h5>
<p>For the past ten years, Adeline Yankoski’s parents have gathered her friends and family members to form Team Adeline for the HLAA New Jersey Walk4Hearing. The team walks to help educate people about hearing loss, while supporting and empowering those who are just like she is. Team Adeline’s mission includes helping 11-year-old Adeline remember that she can do anything she wants to do, with her power-pink hearing aids.</p>

The team is also a top fundraiser, generating $36,000 over ten years.</p>
<p>When the annual Walk4Hearing went virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic, Adeline’s family decided to organize their own walk at the beach. Team Adeline’s members range in age from two to 80-plus, and the team now does two walks each year. One is organized the day before HLAA’s walk takes place, and the other is held on the Walk’s official date in Mercer County Park, New Jersey.</p>
<h5><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rockin’ My Hot Pink Hearing Aids!</strong></span></h5>
<p>&#8220;I like to dance, play soccer and surf—I just bought my surfboard this summer after saving up for two years. I wear hot pink hearing aids and rock them!</p>
<p>&#8220;We have walked more than 90,000 steps over the past nine years with Walk4Hearing! We get to see, meet, walk with and help kids just like me. I love walking with my friends and family. Last year, we had more than 30 people on Team Adeline, including my two best friends. My message to kids like me is, &#8216;Keep being yourself and hang loose!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always love to hear kids ask me, &#8216;What are those things in your ears?&#8217; I say the same thing every time: &#8216;They help me hear better.&#8217; I’ve had a lot of practice. I always get uncomfortable when kids stare at me, but when they do, I just smile, wave and tell myself, &#8216;It’s OK. Everyone is different.&#8217;”</p>
<p>The next <a href="https://www.walk4hearing.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&amp;eventID=517" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>New Jersey Walk4Hearing</strong></a> will be held on Sunday, October 13, 2024. </p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 4rem;"><strong>A Mom’s Experience with her Child&#8217;s Hearing Loss</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes you don’t want your mother’s intuition to be correct. That was my thought the day I heard the doctor say, “You were right—Olivia has bilateral hearing loss, and it’s permanent. She’ll need to wear hearing aids.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_26264" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26264" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-26264" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/rodriguez-family.jpg" alt="Rodriguez family picture by a stream" width="250" height="184" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26264" class="wp-caption-text">The Rodriguez family</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those words rang in my ears for weeks, even months later. Even though I had known deep down that my concerns were warranted, hearing the confirmation out loud was difficult to process. My brain started swirling with questions. Was it something I could have prevented? Will it get worse? Was it from the chronic ear infections she had? What will the diagnosis mean for Olivia’s future?</p>
<p>Olivia’s formal diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss came on June 1, 2023, just a week before she turned six. She had been heavily into gymnastics and was just finishing kindergarten—her first year in a dual immersion program, learning Spanish.  </p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Signs of a Problem</strong></span></h3>
<figure id="attachment_26251" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26251" style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-26251" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/olivia-with-teacher.jpg" alt="Olivia with her teacher" width="192" height="215" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26251" class="wp-caption-text">Olivia with her teacher, Mrs. Jauregui</figcaption></figure>
<p>By the end of the school year, there were many concerns that I couldn’t dismiss. Frequent ear infections and often having to repeat ourselves when speaking to Olivia. Her iPad volume was always up full blast, with us asking her to turn it down.</p>
<p>When I volunteered in her classroom, I noticed her closely watching classmates to follow along and stay on task. I wasn’t sure if this was from learning a new language or not being able to hear instructions.</p>
<p>Eventually our ENT agreed to a hearing test. She missed responding to a few of the beeps, but the audiologist said, “it’s very common at this age.” I found myself in a similar position to many other parents—insisting that my child be tested further and resisting a professional’s advice to wait and see. I trusted my intuition that something was wrong.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Diagnosis and the Road to Acceptance</strong></span></h3>
<p>When we got the definitive news of Olivia’s hearing loss, I cried on the way home and again when I told my husband. A few days later, I casually mentioned to her that just like some people wear glasses to see better, others wear hearing aids to hear better. I told her that the doctor said she needs to wear hearing aids and I showed her some photos of other kids wearing them.</p>
<p>She asked me if she’d have to wear them only for a day. I told her no. She asked, “two days?” Her eyes welled up with tears, and I didn’t have the heart to tell her yet that she was going to need them daily. I gave her a hug, and we cried a lot over the next several days. She asked hard questions like, “Why me?” and confided she was worried about the kids at school making fun of her. She vowed to wear her hair down every day to cover them up. Her confidence was depleted.</p>
<p>Knowing your child is going through something so emotional and not knowing how to help them is very difficult. I threw myself into searching for resources. As so many parents in this position do, I dug deep into the internet to learn all I could about her new diagnosis, and how I could help her live her best life.  </p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Finding Hope and a Community of Support</strong></span></h3>
<figure id="attachment_26263" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26263" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-26263" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/olivia-at-long-beach-walk-flexing.jpg" alt="Olivia at the Long Beach Walk4Hearing flexing her arms" width="150" height="221" srcset="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/olivia-at-long-beach-walk-flexing.jpg 332w , https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/olivia-at-long-beach-walk-flexing-305x450.jpg 305w " sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26263" class="wp-caption-text">Olivia at the 2023 Long Beach Walk4Hearing</figcaption></figure>
<p>A mom from an online group told me about the <a href="https://www.hearingloss.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA)</strong></a>, a nationwide organization that offers education, advocacy and support for families facing hearing loss, and their <a href="https://www.walk4hearing.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Walk4Hearing</strong></a> event in Long Beach, CA, happening just a few days later on June 11. As soon as I found the event online, I saw pictures of families and kids with hearing aids smiling and happy. HLAA holds Walks in 21 cities across the country, all designed to raise funds, awareness and give support to families just like mine.</p>
<p>I immediately registered Olivia, my other daughter Audrey and their Aunt Marissa. Although it was only 10 days after her diagnosis, I was anxious for Olivia to see hearing loss in a fun environment and other kids in the same position. I hoped to show Olivia a community of support and a place where hearing loss is normalized, not stigmatized.</p>
<p>For this particular Walk, there happened to be a drawing to win a free pair of donated Oticon hearing aids, and each of us completed the online entry form. I hadn’t even considered the potential costs of devices, insurance coverage or other expenses yet. I just knew I was desperate for some hope and emotional support for my daughter, and I filled out everything I could to be all in for the event.</p>
<p>The Walk took place in a fun location near beautiful ocean views, shops and restaurants. There were magicians, a face painter and other children wearing colorful hearing devices with cute charms that Olivia was taken with. She liked seeing all the different colors of the earmolds as well—a huge change in attitude.</p>
<p>The feeling of support, joy and hope were overpowering that day, and Olivia seemed to feel it, too. We overheard the announcements of prizes for the fundraising teams and then the grand prize of free hearing aids. I’ll never forget how excited we were when they drew Marissa’s name! She immediately donated the hearing aids to Olivia—who felt like the luckiest winner. It was a long way from her “Why me?” attitude from just days before.</p>
<figure id="attachment_26249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26249" style="width: 175px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-26249" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/olivias-pink-hearing-aids.jpg" alt="Olivia's pink hearing aids" width="175" height="212" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26249" class="wp-caption-text">Olivia&#8217;s pink hearing aids</figcaption></figure>
<p>Leaving the Walk, I asked Olivia what color hearing aids she would get, and she said definitively, “pink!”  I noticed her eyes were wide open and her face looked bright, something I hadn’t seen since the diagnosis. It was a special moment of hope that I owe to Walk4Hearing.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Hearing Aids Highs and Lows</strong></span></h3>
<p>We had Olivia’s final hearing aid fitting a few months later, and I will never forget her smile when the audiologist turned them on for the first time.  The first thing she did when we got back in the car was turn down the volume of her iPad. We noticed a huge difference right away in her hearing ability.</p>
<p>But Olivia remained uncomfortable wearing her hearing aids to school, often crying, and wanting to wear her hair down to cover them. She eventually stopped wanting to go to gymnastics, too. We continued to find new strategies to help her feel much more comfortable. Her teacher and I decided to read a book about hearing loss to Olivia’s classmates, showed them her hearing aids and answered all their questions. That seemed to take the pressure off and the very next day, Olivia asked to wear her hair up in a ponytail again!</p>
<figure id="attachment_26250" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26250" style="width: 175px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-26250" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/olivia-with-gymnastics-coach-nicole.jpg" alt="Olivia with her gymnastics coach" width="175" height="246" srcset="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/olivia-with-gymnastics-coach-nicole.jpg 350w , https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/olivia-with-gymnastics-coach-nicole-321x450.jpg 321w " sizes="(max-width: 175px) 100vw, 175px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26250" class="wp-caption-text">Olivia with gymnastics coach Nicole</figcaption></figure>
<p>Although it’s been a process, with a few steps back here and there, Olivia is adjusting to her new normal and learning to advocate for herself. She is now back in gymnastics, doing well in school and even cried when I had to take her hearing aids in for a check recently because she didn’t want to go without them.</p>
<p>It’s a relief to see her happy again, and it all began with last year’s Walk4Hearing. Winning the hearing aids allowed us to fully focus on Olivia’s emotional well-being, and seeing so many others in similar situations gave us the hope we needed for her future.</p>
<p>Since her initial diagnosis, we’ve learned that her hearing loss is progressive, and we are seeking answers. I am now volunteering on the planning committee for the <a href="https://www.walk4hearing.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&amp;eventID=508" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2024 Long Beach Walk4Hearing</strong></a> in June. I would like to help bring that same spirit of empowerment to others facing hearing loss, and I want Olivia to be a part of this amazing community of support.</p>

<p>I was honored to serve as a panelist for <a href="http://hearingloss.org/joyofmusic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Joy of Music/Loving Your Ears Research Symposium</strong></a> at the HLAA 2023 Convention in New Orleans. It was clear from all the questions the panel received that music listening is an important topic for people with hearing loss. Even though I am a cognitive neuroscientist researching music perception with hearing loss, I found myself leaning on my conservatory training as a classical pianist when answering many of the questions. This article summarizes the top questions from the symposium and some recommendations, drawing from my music conservatory background.</p>
<h5><strong>Problem #1: I can’t understand song lyrics at live concerts.</strong></h5>
<h5 style="letter-spacing: 0.2px;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26169 alignright" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/LiveConcert.jpeg" alt="Picture of a live concert" width="318" height="158" /></strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Advice: Study in advance like a musician.</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Before the concert, study the pieces, particularly making sense of each song&#8217;s lyrics and overall story. Understand how the lyrics differ between chorus vs. verses.</li>
<li>Listeners without hearing loss may also struggle with this because of Problem #2.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Problem #2: It’s so loud and distracting at a live concert that I can’t hear anything.</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Advice: Frame expectations going into a concert.</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Live concerts can be challenging due to large crowds and environmental noise. Also, the sound may seem quite different from the recording (for example, people could be singing out of tune or the venue’s acoustics and speakers might amplify and even distort the sound). But this is also what makes concerts exciting!</li>
<li>Reframe your expectations to know that you’ll be walking into a situation that may sound quite different from your listening experience at home.</li>
<li>Right after the concert, listen to a pristine sound recording like the CD and watch the official music videos to reinforce your memories of the concert and to help your music perception.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Problem #3: I was in a choir/band/music group and received a cochlear implant or hearing aids. Now, it sounds awful. It makes me not want to participate in musical groups anymore.</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Advice: Be patient. It takes time. Practice makes perfect.</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Just as musicians must practice long hours, practice makes perfect when learning to use your hearing aid or CI. Work with your audiologist to adjust the settings over time.</li>
<li>Rhythm is often the most preserved element for CI users—begin by <strong>listening/focusing on music with rhythmic elements</strong>. Some of my favorites:
<ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-top: 1rem;">
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/C7HL5wYqAbU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kodo Taiko</strong></a> Japanese drumming group<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-26170 alignright" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/TaikoDrumming.jpg" alt="Group of three people playing Taiko drumming" width="273" height="201" /></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/CZSTFAWfQEg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>STOMP</strong></a> stage show</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practice by yourself (i.e., solo) for a chunk of time. Then, when you’re ready, try rejoining the group.</li>
<li>Don’t rely on your ears—<strong>record yourself playing</strong>. Performing musicians know that how we hear something at our instrument on stage differs from what the audience hears in a cavernous concert hall. I’ve always recorded myself repeatedly while taking notes on my scores to improve my playing. Also, <strong>ask a teacher or coach to help you.</strong> Rely on others to be your “auditory mirrors.”</li>
<li><strong>Use technology.</strong> Use a tuner to check if you are out of tune. Use metronomes. These can now be found easily as phone apps. Use these tools to aid you; professional musicians use all tools available.</li>
<li><strong>Consider</strong> <strong>in-ear monitors</strong>. Professional musicians wear customized in-ear monitors to help them hear themselves and protect their hearing. For example, see HLAA 2023 Research Symposium panelist Michael Santucci’s work at <a href="https://www.sensaphonics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Sensaphonics</strong></a>. You can purchase in-ear monitors as alternatives to hearing aids<strong>. </strong><a href="https://grandpianopassion.com/alternative-hearing-aids-music-3dme-in-ear-monitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>See this review</strong></a> of ASI Audio’s 3DME In-Ear Monitors by Nancy Williams.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Additional Tips to Enhance Music Listening</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><strong>Use sound jackets to enhance your experience of live music concerts: <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-26171 alignright" src="https://150127906.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/sound-shirt.jpg" alt="A woman wearing a sound shirt" width="188" height="255" /></strong></h6>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Chicago Lyric Opera is piloting the <a href="https://www.lyricopera.org/shows/your-visit/accessibility/soundshirt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SoundShirt</strong></a>: When sound is recorded, engineers mix the music and transform the sound data into the SoundShirt. This, combined with English subtitles or sign language interpretation, provides a full experiential immersion with an opera. <a href="https://youtu.be/yhInVfKjc-A"><strong>Watch on YouTube</strong></a>.</li>
<li>SoundShirts are manufactured by <a href="https://cutecircuit.com/soundshirt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CuteCircuit</strong></a>.</li>
<li>You can also use something else that transmits the vibrations. Anecdotally, I’ve heard about people who are deaf holding balloons to their chests at concerts to feel the vibrations of the music.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h6><strong>Become an expert listener:</strong></h6>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Musical training teaches musicians to be expert listeners. When we hear a composition, we don’t simply listen to it once. We listen to it multiple times, gradually transforming our understanding of the piece. We study the history and social context that surrounds a composition or composer. We read analyses of compositions.</li>
<li>So, if music has lyrics, study the lyrics and the poetry. Analyze it. Expert listening skills can be developed through music appreciation classes or focused listening. Nancy Williams is an amateur pianist with hearing loss who writes blog posts about this at <a href="https://grandpianopassion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Grand Piano Passion</strong></a>.</li>
<li>For pop music, this may involve watching music videos, reading interviews with the artist and studying the lyrics vs. instruments by themselves. For example, Apple Music allows you to see the lyrics. Then, you can invoke <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/12/apple-introduces-apple-music-sing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Apple Music Sing</strong></a> to hear the instrumental portion of the music separately.</li>
<li>How does the song change over time regarding shifts in emotion, sound quality, dynamics and instrumentation? Studying these “landmarks” and understanding the structure of the music will make you a more informed listener.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>There’s good news for residents of Washington state who wear hearing aids—a new law now requires some large group health plans to cover the cost of hearing aids and services. And some Kaiser Foundation Health Plan members may be eligible for reimbursement for their hearing aids under a recent class action lawsuit settlement if they act before May 4, 2024.</p>
<p>These recent efforts illustrate the importance of the <a href="http://www.hearingloss.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA)</strong></a> and its community of local advocates to spur change across the nation.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Grassroots Efforts Pay Off</span> </strong></h3>
<p>The HLAA Washington State Association was instrumental in pushing for the expanded coverage for hearing aids and services that just went into effect January 1, 2024. <a href="https://hearingloss-wa.org/new-insurance-benefits-for-hearing-aids-in-washington-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>House Bill 1222</strong></a> now requires some large group health plans in the state, and those for public employees, to cover the cost of hearing aids, assessments, adjustment, fitting and training—up to $3,000 per ear every three years. While this law exempts companies that are self-insured, it’s an important precedent, and local advocates continue to push for broader coverage.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.kphearingaidsettlement.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>claims are now being accepted</strong></a> in a class action settlement in Washington for people who bought hearing aids. The case, <em>Schmitt, et al., v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, </em>argues that excluding hearing aids and services violates the Affordable Care Act’s anti-discrimination provision. An opinion by the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, calling the exclusion discriminatory.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Act Fast for Hearing Aid Payouts</span> </strong></h3>
<p>The settlement establishes a $3 million fund that will reimburse people who paid out of pocket for hearing aids and related services from October 30, 2014, through December 31, 2023, and were covered under certain Kaiser Foundation Health plans in Washington state.</p>

</div>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Next Steps and Wider Implications</span> </strong></h3>
<p>HLAA Washington State Association (HLAA-WA) says more legislation could further broaden coverage for hearing aids and services in individual and small group health plans, too. Thanks to <a href="https://hearingloss-wa.org/new-insurance-benefits-for-hearing-aids-in-washington-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SB 5338</strong></a>, also passed last year, the Washington State Insurance Commissioner is seeking the addition of hearing aids to the state’s Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The EHB spells out what every health insurance plan overseen by the state must offer. HLAA-WA hopes others follow suit, potentially influencing Congress to provide coverage to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Since the Kaiser case ended in a settlement between two parties, no court ordered a judgment. But the opinion could be repeated by bringing additional lawsuits in other states if health plans exclude hearing aid coverage based on disability.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;">A Community Pushing for Nationwide Change</span> </strong></h3>
<p>HLAA has more than 120 local chapters that help advocate for change in access to hearing loss care, treatment and accessible communication across the nation. The organization is the leading voice of the growing number of people with—and at risk of—hearing loss in the U.S.</p>
<p>“Change often happens in local communities first, as we’re seeing in Washington, and that’s what HLAA is all about. We show people that they’re not alone—there are 50 million Americans with hearing loss, who need to be empowered to get the care they need to stay healthy and connected to the world around them,” says HLAA Executive Director Barbara Kelley.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://hearingloss-wa.org/new-insurance-benefits-for-hearing-aids-in-washington-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HLAA in Washington state</a> is getting the word out to people in the hearing loss community there who may be eligible for payouts and new coverage. Nationally, the organization is hoping similar challenges follow in other states.</em></strong></p>
